# Guided Question and Introduction
Was a 2019 MLB player's batting ability affected by his age? I will be taking a look at several different batting statistics compared to each player's age, to see if there was any correlation apparent between the two. 

To be more specific, I will be looking at each team in the American League East division, meaning I will be looking at the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays, and Toronto Blue Jays. I will be looking at their players' total plate appearances, hits, home runs, runs batted in (RBIs), stolen bases, on-base percentage (OBP), and weighted on-base plus slugging (OPS+) that they accumulated in the 2019 MLB season. I will be comparing all of these values to each players' age, to see if that has any effect on how well they performed. Each case will be an individual player.


# Importing data
For this project, I will be using data from baseball-reference.com for each of these teams. From there, I can manipulate their tables and get the data I want in the form of .csv data. From there, I can use the "readr" package to copy and paste the data from the website, and read it into R as .csv data.
